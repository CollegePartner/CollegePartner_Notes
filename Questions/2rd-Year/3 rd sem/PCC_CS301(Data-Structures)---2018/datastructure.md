11. Suppose-there are "n" children standing in a circle playing a game. Arbitrarily one of them is designated 
as number 1 and others are numbered in clockwise fashion starting from the child with number 1. Then 
they choOse a lucky number, say "m". Immediately after, they start counting from the child numbered 1 and the counting proceeds in a clockwise manner until the mth child is identified. Then the mth child is 
eliminated from the circle; counting for next round begins from the child next to the eliminated one and 
proceeds until the mth child is identified. This child is then eliminated from the circle and the process goes on till only one child is left who is declared as the winner of the game. Now write an algorithm/c 
program to implement the above game. Inputs of this program is two integers "n" (number of children) and "m (the lucky number) and another integer "j" which is the starting index of the child. Output of the program is an integer which is the index of the winning child.
