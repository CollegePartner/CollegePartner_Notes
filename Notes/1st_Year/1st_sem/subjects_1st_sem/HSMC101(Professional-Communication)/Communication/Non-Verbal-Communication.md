## WHAT IS NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION?
- Non –Verbal communication is a complex process involving people, words, tone of voice and body movements. 

- Simply stated non-verbal communication includes “all other communication than language”.

    ##### Albert Mehrabian found that the total impact of a message is about 7% verbal (words only) 38% vocal (including tone of voice, inflection and other sounds) and 55% non-verbal.
