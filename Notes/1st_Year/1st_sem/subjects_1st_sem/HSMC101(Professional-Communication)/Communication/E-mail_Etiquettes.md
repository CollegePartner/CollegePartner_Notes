## 5 Basic Email Etiquette Rules
**#1:**

 Always include a subject and use the recipient’s name in the greeting

- The need for this will be made clear during out Email Safety Day. 
- Why is a subject important?
    
    #### It informs recipient what the email is about. 
**#2:** 

Do not write in ***ALL CAPITALS*** 
- Writing in all capitals can convey that you are shouting in your message, and nobody likes to be yelled at. 

- Consider other ways to get your message across while conveying its importance. 

- Using all capitals can be annoying and trigger an unintended response.

**#3:** 

Do not use email to discuss confidential information

Take care with abbreviations and emoticons ☺ 
* Save abbreviations like LOL (laugh out loud) or IDK (I don’t know) for text messages among friends.

**#5:** 

THINK before you send\
If you answer yes to all of these questions:
* Is this relevant to the work my organization is doing?

### But if you answer YES to any of these…
* Could this information hurt/embarrass/offend someone?
* Email should not be used for confrontation/yelling/reprimanding 
* Could this email be misinterpreted in a bad way?
* Is this information important to share in the workplace?
* Could this email get me into trouble?

* If an email tells you to “Forward to everyone you know/love/all of your family” do NOT forward.
