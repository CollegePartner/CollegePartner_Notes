## Importance of greetings in social communication.
When you geet a person, you show respect, give them a sense of belonging, and an air of importance. Greeting doesn’t really take anything away from you. Rather, it makes you a likeable person, and one who can safely be termed respectful.
Greeting a person doesn’t really make them your superior, or make you inferior to them. It is just a courtesy, that fine-tunes the personality of individuals.

## Conversation
Starting a conversation involves making people feel relaxed and comfortable. You 
may have to start a conversation while welcoming visitors. And, when you don’t 
know others at a meeting, party or social gathering, you may have to start a 
conversation.

- Starting a conversation involves three steps: 
    
    a) greeting; 
    
    b) introducing yourself;  
    
    c) asking after the other person’s well-being.   

The formulas for these are fixed and usually carry no literal meaning. We say ‘Good 
morning’ even if it is not a good morning and the answer for ‘How are you?’ is ‘Fine, 
thanks,’ even if you are not well. No one, except your close friends, really wants to 
know about your troubles. These are routine courtesies that are followed. The 
expression you use will vary according to your relationship.

## Importance of small talk.
 * Small talk requires important social skills which are highly valued at the workplace. It helps to break the ice before important business meetings and events.
 * Many people are comfortable talking about business but do not know how to 
begin a conversation at business meetings appropriately. This is mostly because 
they do not know what to talk about. It may also be because they are not 
confident about their language. Hence both confidence about what to say and how 
to say it are essential for effective small talk.

## Tips on small talk
 * Be aware of the type of person / people you will be meeting.
 * During your conversation it is advisable to stay away from personal beliefs and controversial topics. 
 * Also do not invade the personal space of the visitor by asking about personal matters like whether s/he is married or not, how many children s/he has, what they are doing, her/his salary, age etc. Subjects like weather, sports, entertainment are safe subjects. 
 * In the course of your initial conversation you may be able to identify some areas of common interest.
 * And most importantly, be a good listener.
 * In some situations, you might be nervous or uncomfortable and not know how to begin. In such cases, letting others state their opinions will improve the quality of the discussion - and give you time to think of an answer.

# Types of greetings:
* Formal greetings.
*  Informal greetings.

---
## What is informal greetings?
Informal greetings can be verbal, gestured, or both. The most common classic greetings are "hello" and "hi", while "hey" is popular in some regions and with some slices of society. The person's name generally accompanies the "hello", along with a pleasant smile. In some regions, "good morning", "good afternoon", and "good evening" are still common.

---
## What is formal greetings?
* The verbal greeting is generally the same, "Hello Mr. Johnson" or "How do you do Ms. Lockhart?" The formality of the situation is generally marked by the nonverbal cues accompanying the verbal greeting. In business environments, coworkers may be casual with each other but offer more deference to their boss. In a formal receiving line, even those who know each other well will tend to shake hands or exchange social kisses, offer a polite comment, then move on so as not to hold up the receiving line.

* Formal greeting are characterized by first what is said – use "hello" rather than "hi" or certainly "hey". Tone of voice and posture should also be considered. These greetings tend to be rather brief, but should always be pleasant and genuine.

## Greetings at home
Home is the best place to cultivate good greeting manners. Often, people will omit this courtesy, skipping the "good morning" at the start of the day, or welcoming someone home from work or school with only "dinner's ready", "do you have homework?" or "the dog messed in the house again." Only a couple of seconds are required to acknowledge the presence of those we live with. This simple gesture makes life far more pleasant, sets a good example for everyone, and cultivates a habit of greeting others regularly.

## 7 golden rules for formal greetings
* Stand Up

When you’re greeting new people, do so face-to-face. It’s just polite, and shows respect. It means that you consider them important enough to change your physical position for them. It also helps you to make eye contact.
* Look them in the Eye

Making eye contact indicates engagement and focus. It shows that you’re interested in the other person. Staring at your shoes, your watch, or your phone shows the opposite, and suggests disengagement. Use positive body language. 
* Smile
 
 Even if you’re carrying the woes of the world on your shoulders, try to look happy to see your new acquaintance. A grimace immediately puts the other person on the defensive, while a smile is welcoming and inclusive.
*   Take the Initiative With a Handshake

Approach the person you’re greeting and extend your hand. You’ll come across as confident and assertive, not aggressive. Don’t wait for the other person to take a lead.
Keep it simple: shake firmly, but avoid the “death grip.” A “limp fish” leaves an equally poor impression. And keep your spare hand by your side: two-handed pumping and hands on shoulders are strictly for politicians.
* Introduce yourself.

Even better, say why you’re there and what you do. “Hi, I’m Paula” is a start. “Hi, I’m Paula. I’m an account manager with the Client Success team. How can I help?” is actually useful, and shows you’re making the effort.


* Observe the Hierarchy

If you’re making the introductions, remember business etiquette. Introduce less senior people to more senior ones. Start with the name of the senior person, then introduce the junior person to them.
As you did when you introduced yourself, give some context. So, “Colette, may I introduce Phil? Phil is our new lead developer. Phil, Colette is our chief financial officer.”
* Get the Name Game Right

Make sure that you remember the name of anyone you’ve been introduced to, and use the name properly. It’s better to ask the person to repeat the name than to keep using an incorrect version.
Wait for permission before using someone’s first name. It’s respectful. Some people don’t like informality from the get-go, and it may be seen as culturally insensitive.

## Helpful tips
1) Americans shake hands when first introduced to new people. Rarely do they 
shake hands while parting. In India it is customary to shake hands as part of leave 
taking. 
2) When someone pays you a compliment, it should be accepted graciously with a 
thank you rather than a denial. A Westerner would accept the compliment 
whereas an Indian is normally modest about it. 
3) Titles are highly valued in some cultures including India. Advanced degrees are 
listed on business cards and mentioned in introductions. This must be kept in 
mind during introductions. 
4) Greetings and leave taking generally follow a hierarchical order in India. 
5) Indians generally do not use first names in business, even in conversations. This 
is not the case in the US and England. However, most European countries prefer 
the formal surname and some, for example Germans, are particular about the use 
of the business title during greetings and introductions. 
6) In India ‘sir’ is frequently used to address someone in authority. It is not so in the 
US.
