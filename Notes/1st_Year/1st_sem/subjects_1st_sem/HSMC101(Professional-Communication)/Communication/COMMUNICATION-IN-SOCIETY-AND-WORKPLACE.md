## Difference between social and workplace communication

- One of the first differences in business communication is that it is much more formal than social communication.
- Business communications often need to happen much faster than social ones.
- Hierarchy is important in business communications, whereas it may have less significance socially. 
- Mistakes in spelling, grammar, and punctuation are acceptable in social communication. This is not the case in business settings. Failure to pay attention to these details may be viewed as sloppy and can cause a bad impression.

## What is social communication?
Social communication refers to the emergence of verbal and nonverbal skills, social interaction, and social cognition. It is often viewed as a form of communication that is ‘unwritten’ and that people seem to ‘just know.’ Communication in this area includes interaction with peers, family members, providers, and educators. Social communication behaviors include understanding and using appropriate facial expressions, eye contact, and body language.

## What is workplace communication?

## Skills for effective workplace communication.
* Getting the message across efficiently depends on the skills of the communicator such as presentation skills, group facilitation skills, negotiation and written communication skills. Successful communication also depends upon the capacity of the employees to understand the information. This may require providing employees with basic financial literacy such as financial statements, sales, profitability, etc.
