# DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT
## DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT
Diffraction refers to various phenomena that occur when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit. It is defined as the bending of waves around the corners of an obstacle or through an aperture into the region of geometrical
shadow of the obstacle/aperture. The diffracting object or aperture effectively becomes a secondary source of the propagating wave.

## TYPES OF DIFFRACTION
**FRESNEL DIFFRACTION**

If the source is located at a finite distance from the slit, and the screen is also at a finite distance from the slit. The source and the screen are not very far from each other.

**FRAUNHOFER DIFFRACTION**

When the source and the screen are far away from each other, and when the source is located at the infinite position, then the ray of light coming from that infinite source are parallel rays of light.

## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRESNEL & FRAUNHOFER DIFFRACTION
**Fresnel Diffraction**
* Here the wavefront used is spherical
* An image is formed at a finite distance.
* A lens is not required.

**Fraunhofer Diffraction**
* Here the wavefront used is plane.
* An image is formed at an infinite distance.
* A lens is required.

## FRAUNHOFER SINGLE SLIT DIFFRACTION
***Diffraction basics***

**Problem:** A propagating wave encounters an obstacle (i.e. a
distortion of the wave-front occurs). How will the distortion
influence the propagation of the wave?

***Fraunhofer diffraction:***

The resultant wave is measured very far away from the place where the wave-front was distorted (R>>size of the obstacle)

***General approach:***

1. Split the wave-front into infinitely small segments and consider
emission of secondary wavelets (using Huygens principle)

2. Fix the direction of observation and calculate the combined electric field of all wavelets from all original segments taking into account difference in optical path length and amplitude Why do we study diffraction on slits, circular apertures etc: to understand basics, and due to high relevance to applications.

## History of discovery of diffraction
The effects of diffraction of light were first observed
and characterized by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in the
17th century. James Gregory (1638–1675) observed
the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather.
Thomas Young performed a celebrated experiment in
1803 demonstrating interference from two closely
spaced slits. Augustin-Jean Fresnel did systematic
studies and calculations of diffraction around 1815.
This gave great support to the wave theory of light
that had been developed by Christiaan Huygens in
the 17th century. Joseph von Fraunhofer was a
famous German optician, who perfected
manufacture of highest quality glass in Bavaria.

## The Single Slit

Electric field measured at the distant point P:

$E(θ) = ε_L / R$  



$ε_L$ ”source” strength per unit length

## Single Slit Fraunhofer Diffraction
**Condition**
* Single slit width (b) is of the order of the wavelength of the light,

* Distance of the slit from the screen (L) should be such that L>> b away from the slit.

* The intensity is a function of angle.

**Explanation**

* Huygens' principle tells us that each part of the slit can be thought of as an emitter of waves. All these waves interfere to produce the diffraction pattern. Where crest meets crest we have constructive interference and
where crest meets trough we have destructive interference.

Fraunhofer approximation, is only valid when the source, aperture, and
detector are all very far apart or when lenses are used to convert spherical waves into plane waves. Being very far apart means that the distances between source, aperture, and detector must be much greater than the width of the aperture.


**Minima of Intensity in Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a single slit:**

* minima is achived at observation angles $θ$ where $sin(π(b/λ) sinθ)$ vanishes, i.e $sin(θmin) = ± n λ/b$ but not for $n = 0$ , only for $n = 1, 2 ...$

* The separation between minima widens when the wavelengths increases or the
slit width decreases

* This is why when slit is very narrow $b ≈ 0$ , the first minima is far away and one has continous distribution of light.

* $sinθ$ varies from **-1** to **1**with zero achieved straight ahead of the slit. Thus, the
number of minima observed is 
$n_{min} = 2 sin(b/λ)$

If slit is narrower than the wavelength, $b< λ$, no minima are observed.

**Maxima of Intensity in Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a single slit:**

* The main maxima of intensity is at **$θ = 0$**

* Because main maximum is where minimum is expected to be for **$n=0$**, it is twice wider than other maxima, occuping space between minima at $± λ/b$. . It's width in terms of $sinθ$ is $2 λ/b$

* Positions of other maxima are only approximately halfway between the minima
$sin(θ_{max}) ≈ ± (n + ½) λ/b$

* Depending on **$n$** we speak about first order $(n=±1)$, second order $(n=±2)$
etc. maxima.\
The approximate value of peak intensity at the maximum $n > 0$ is then\
$I_m ≈ I_0 / ( π^2 (n + ½)^2)$.

## GRATING/ N – SLITS/ MULTIPLE SLITS
An arrangement consisting of a very large number (N) of identical parallel slits of equal width placed side by side and separated from one another by equal opaque spaces is known as Grating/ N-Slits/ Multiple Slits.

**TYPES OF GRATING**

* Reflection Grating

* Transmission Grating

---

## PLANE TRANSMISSION GRATING
Gratings are constructed by ruling equidistant parallel
lines on a transparent material such as glass, with a
fine diamond point.
* The ruled lines are opaque to light

* The space between any two lines is transparent to
light and acts as a slit.

---
## CALCULATION
Path difference between two consecutive slits be $(a+b)Sinθ.$

→ Phase difference $δ$ = (2 $\pi$ /$λ$) $(a+b) Sin\theta $.
$= 2γ,$

Let $E_1, E_2, E_3$ ........ are the waves from several slits.

Then, $E_1 = A_0 (Sin β/β) cos (ωt – β)$ , $β=π asinθ/λ$


$E_2 = A_0 (Sin β/β) cos (ωt – β - φ_1)$


$E_3 = A_0 (Sinβ / β) cos (ωt – β – φ_2)$

....................

$E_n = A_0 (Sinβ/β) cos (ωt – β – φ_{n-1})$

**Total disturbance at point $p_1$ is $E = E_1 + E_2 + ... E_n$**

= $A_0 (Sinβ/β) (Sin N_\gamma/Sin \gamma) e^{iθ}$


**Resultant Intensity** $I = A_0^ 2 (Sin^2β/β^2) (Sin^2 N_\gamma/Sin^2 \gamma)$

Here, $I_0 = A_0^2$ is $I_{max}$ when $β → 0$ and $γ → 0$

$I_1 = I_0 Sin^2 β / β^2$ → diffraction pattern due to single
slit

$I_2$ = $sin^2 N\gamma$ / $sin^2 \gamma$ → Interference pattern due to
secendary waves from $N$ slits.

When $N = 1$, $I$ gives the expression for Single Slit

When $N = 2$, $I$ gives the expression for Double Slit

If a is small and the observation is confined to the neighbourhood of central pattern then variation of

$sin^2 β$ / $β^2$ is very small and $I$ depends on $I_2$

**CONDITION FOR MAXIMA**

$I_2$ → maximum, when $sin^2 N\gamma$ / $sin^2 \gamma$ → maximum

$i.e.,$ $sinγ → 0, γ = ±nπ, n = 0, 1, 2....$

$γ = \pi (a+b)sin \theta / λ $ $= ± nπ$

$(a+b)sin\theta _n =  ± nπ $  → Grating Equation


$n = 0$ → CENTRAL MAXIMUM (ZERO ORDER SPECTRUM)

$n = 1$ → FIRST ORDER MAXIMA

$n = 2$ → SECOND ORDER MAXIMA

[APPEAR ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ZERO_TH ORDER MAXIMUM]

When , $γ = ±nπ,   I_2 = N^2$

$I = N^2 I_0 sin^2 β / β^2$

* Intensity of principal maxima increases with the increase in number of slits

* Intensity of principal maxima decreases with the increase in order number.
---
## CONDITION FOR OTHER MAXIMA AND MINIMA
$dI_2 / dγ = 0$

**Secondary Minima:**  $SinN_γ/Sin γ = 0$

$(a+b) sinθ = λ/N, 2λ/N, 3λ/N, (N-1)λ/N,$

$(N+1)λ/N....(2N-1)λ/N, (2N+1)λ/N,$

$(2N+2)λ/N........$

**Secondary Maxima:** $N cot N_γ = cotγ$

$I_{sm} = N^2 / 1+(N^2-1)sin^2γ$

$I_{sm} / I_{pm} = 1 / 1+(N^2 - 1)sin^2γ$




The grating intensity expression gives a peak intensity which is proportional to the square of the number of slits illuminated. Increasing the number of slits not only makes the diffraction
maximum sharper, but also much more intense. If a 1 mm diameter laser beam strikes a 600 line/mm grating, then it
covers 600 slits and the resulting line intensity is 90,000 x that of
a double slit.

* It is a matter of design to choose slit width a, slit separation d and number of slits N . Smaller the a, less diffraction pattern from the individual slit modulates the spectrum

* Smaller d, wider the angle to the maximum, but only lower order spectra are
available, which may affect chromatic resolution.

* Larger N , higher the resolution and intensity, but more difficult to
manufacture and larger the grating is.

## Fraunhofer Diffraction
**MISSING ORDER**

If the conditions for maxima of interference pattern and minima of
diffraction pattern are satisfied simultaneously for a given value of θ,
then the corresponding interference maxima will be missing/absent
due to non availability of light on these positions on the screen.

In the plane diffraction grating let

* The slit width is a
* The separation between the slits is d

    ►Depending on the relative values of ‘a’ and ‘d’ certain orders of interference maxima will be missing in the resultant pattern.

The condition of interference maxima are given by

$(a + d) Sinθ = nλ …………………….Eq.1$

The condition of diffraction minima are given by

$d Sinθ = pλ ………………………….Eq.2$

Where, n and p are integers.

Dividing Eq. 1 by Eq. 2 we get 

$(a+d) / d = n / p $
 
***Case 1***

Let $a = d$      $ → n = 2p$

If
$p = 1,2,3,….$

Then
$n = 2,4,6,…$

So, **the orders 2, 4, 6, etc. of the interference maxima will be missing** in the diffraction pattern.

***Case 2***

Let $a = 2d → n = 3p$

If
$p = 1,2,3,….$

Then
$n = 3,6,9,…$

So, **the orders 3, 6, 9, etc. of the interference maxima will be missing**
in the diffraction pattern.

***Case 3***

Let $a+d = a → n = p$

If
$p = 1,2,3,….$

Then
$n = 1,2,3,….$

So, **diffraction minima and interference maxima will be on the same position on the screen.**

* All interference maxima will be missing.

* Only diffraction maxima will be found, behave like Single Slit of width 2a.

## RAYLEIGH CRITERION

Two nearby images are said to be resolved if the position of
principal maximum of one coincides with the first secondary
minimum of the other and vice versa. There are three conditions:

1.  Not Resolved.

2.  Well Resolved

3.  Just Resolved

When the difference in wavelengths is smaller and such that the central maximum of the wavelength coincides with the first minimum of the other as shown in figure, then the resultant intensity curve is as shown by the thick curve. The curve
shows a distinct dip in the middle of two central maxima. Thus the two wavelengths can be distinguished from one another and according to Rayleigh they are said to be ***“Just Resolved”.***

If the difference in wavelengths is such that their principal
maxima are separately visible, then there is a distinct point of
zero intensity in between the two wavelengths. Hence
according to Rayleigh they are said to be ***“Resolved”.***

When the difference in wavelengths is so small that the central
maxima corresponding to two wavelengths come still closer as
shown in figure, then the resultant intensity curve is quite smooth
without any dip. This curve is as if there is only one wavelength
somewhat bigger and stronger. Hence according to Rayleigh the two
wavelengths are ***“Not Resolved”.***
