# INTERFERENCE
## INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT

- The phenomenon in which alternate
bright and dark bands (fringes) are
produced as a result of superposition of
two waves

- In general, the individual waves do not
affect one another, and the total wave
amplitude at any point in space is simply
the sum of the amplitudes of the
individual waves at that point.

---
## TYPES OF INTERFERENCE
- Constructive interference

- Destructive interference
---
## CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE
- It is a type of interference where the two interfering waves
have a displacement in the same direction

## DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE

- It is a type of interference where the two interfering
waves have a displacement in the opposite direction


---
## ANALYTICAL TREATMENT OF INTERFERENCE
$y_1 = asin 2 π/λ (vt – r_1)$

$y_2 = b sin 2 π/λ (vt – r_2)$

$I = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab cos δ$

where,     $δ = 2π / λ (r_1 - r_2 )$

---
## CONDITION FOR BRIGHTNESS
$cos δ = +1, Imax = (a+b)^2$
$= 4 a^2$ when $a=b$

i.e., path difference $(r_1 – r_2)$ = even multiple of $λ/2$

Or, phase difference (δ) = even multipe of π

---
## CONDITION FOR DARKNESS
$cos δ = -1, Imin = (a-b)^2$ 

= $0$ when $a=b$

i.e., path difference $(r_1 – r_2)$ = odd multiple of $λ/2$

Or, phase difference (δ) = odd multipe of π

## PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION OF WAVES

- When two or more waves are incident on a same point,
the total displacement at that point is equal to the vector
sum of the displacements of the individual waves

* If a crest of a wave meets a crest of another wave of the
same frequency at the same point, then the magnitude of
the displacement is the sum of individual magnitudes, that
is constructive interference.

* If a crest of a wave meets a trough of another wave of the
same frequency at the same point, then the magnitude of
the displacement is the difference in the individual
magnitudes, then is known as destructive interference.

## HUYGEN’S WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT
Every point on a wave-front may be considered a source of secondary spherical wavelets which spread out in the forward direction at the speed
of light. The new wave-front is the tangential surface to all of these secondary wavelets.

---
## COHERENCE
**Coherence is a measure of the correlation between the phases measured at differen (temporal and spatial) points on a wave.**

* Temporal Coherence is a measure of the correlation of light
wave’s phase at different points along the direction of
propagation – it tells us how monochromatic a source is.

* Spatial Coherence is a measure of the correlation of a light
wave’s phase at different points transverse to the direction of
propagation - it tells us how uniform the phase of a wavefront is.

## ENERGY CONSERVATION IN INTERFERENCE
**Energy is always conserved in the process of interference. The
energy that disappreas at the destructive interference, apprear
at the point of constructive interference and vice versa.**

If two identical waves having amplitudes $a_1$ and $a_2$ are
superimposed and undergo interference then

$Imax = (a_1 + a_2 )^2$    and 

$I min = (a_1 - a_2 )^2$

Therefore, $Iaverage = a_1^2 + a_2^2$

In absence of interference, total intensity

$I = I_1 +I_2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2$

## STOKE’S LAW IN OPTICS
When a light wave is reflected from the surface of an
optically denser medium, it suffers a phase change of $π$
but it suffers no change in phase when reflected at the
surface of optically rarer medium.

---
## CONDITIONS FOR PERMANENT INTERFERENCE

* Sources must be monochromatic (same
wavelength), amplitudes should differ
as little possible

* The sources of the waves must be
coherent,which means they emit
identical waves with a constant phase
difference.

* Two sources must be narrow

* Two sources must lie close to each
other

* Sources must emit continuous waves of
same wavelength and time period.

* Two interfering waves must be in the
same state of polarization

## NEWTON’S RINGS
**Newton's rings is a phenomenon in which
an interference pattern is created by the
reflection of light between two surfaces: a
spherical surface and an adjacent touching
flat surface. It is named after
Isaac Newton, who investigated the effect.**

---
## METHODS OF PRODUCTION OF INTERFERENCE
- Division of Wavefront: wave is divided in space

    ##### Example: Young's double slit interferometer, bi Prism and Lloyd's mirror

* Division of Amplitude: In this method,
the amplitude of the incident beam is divided into two or more parts either by partial reflection or refraction.

    ##### Example: Newton’s Ring,Interferometer.

## NEWTON’S RING BY REFLECTED RAYS
################################ image ########################

---
## NEWTON’S RING EXPERIMENT
* Monochromatic ligh is incident normally on a combination of
plano convex lens placed on a glass plate

* A part of each incident ray is reflected from the lower surface of
the lens, and a part, after refraction through the air film
between the lens and the plate, is reflected back from the plate
surface.

* These two reflected rays are coherent, hence they will interfere
and produce a system of alternate dark and bright rings with
the point of contact between the lens and the plate as the
center. These rings are known as Newton’s ring.

* For a normal incidence of monochromatic light, the path
difference between the reflected rays is very nearly equal to
2µt where µ and t are the refractive index and thickness of the
air-film respectively.

## NEWTON’S RING BY REFLECTED LIGHT
* ***CONDITION FOR MAXIMA:***

    * $2µt + λ/2= 2nλ/2$

*   ***CONDITION FOR MINIMA:***

    * $2µt + λ/2 = (2n + 1) λ/2$

$µ$ is R.I. of the materials trapped

$ λ$ is the wavelength of the monochromatic
light used

***RADIUS OF DARK RINGS:***
 
 $r_n = \sqrt{n λ R / µ }$

***RADIUS OF BRIGHT RINGS:***

$r_n = \sqrt{[ (n +1/2) λ R ] / µ} $

$λ = µ ( D_{m+n}^2 - D_n^2 ) / 4 m R$

## NEWTON’S RING BY TRANSMITTED RAYS

######################### image ############

***CONDITION FOR MAXIMA:***

$2µt = nλ$

***CONDITION FOR MINIMA:***

$2µt = (n +_-  1/2) λ$

---
## IMPORTANT
* IN CASE OF NEWTON’S RING FORMED BY TRANSMITTED RAYS, THERE IS NO PHASE CHANGE BECAUSE THE REFLECTION IS NOT CONSIDERED. SO THE TWO RAYS ARE IN PHASE AND THE CENTRAL POINT IS BRIGHT.

* THE CONDITION FOR DARK AND BRIGHT IN REFLECTED RAYS ARE JUST OPPOSITE TO THOSE FROMED BY TRANSMITTED RAYS

* THE LOCUS OF POINTS OF CONSTANT THICKNESS OF AIR WEDGE FILM LIES ON A CIRCLE WITH THE POINT OF CONTACT OF PLANO CONVEX LENS AND GLASS PLATE AS
CENTRE, HENCE CONSTANT PATH DIFFERENCE IS A CIRCLE AS SEEN FROM THE TOP. SO **NEWTONS RINGS** ARE **CIRCULAR.**

---
## APPLICATION OF NEWTON’S RING

* Determination of Wavelength of Light

    * $λ = [µ ( D_{m+n}^2 - D_n^2 )] / [4 m R]$

* Determinarion of Radius of Curvature of Plano Convex Lens

    * $R = [µ ( D_{m+n}^2 - D_n^2 )] / [4 m λ]$

* Determination of Fringe Width:

    * $β = R λ / D_n$

* Determination of R. I. of an unknown Liquid

    * $µ =( D_{m+n}^2 – D_n^2) / (D_{m+n’}^2 - D_{n’}^2)$
