## Binary Number System:

A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one). 

### BCD

In computing and electronic systems, binary-coded decimal (BCD) is a class of binary encodings of decimal numbers where each digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, usually four or eight.

Decimal 	-BCD

0 	  -   0000

1     -	0001

2 	-    0010

3  -	0011

4  -	0100

5  -	0101

6 	- 0110

7 	- 0111

8 	- 1000

9 	-  1001

Using this conversion, the number 25, for example, would have a BCD number of 0010 0101 or 00100101. However, in binary, 25 is represented as 11001.

## ASCII

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes.

ASCII was the first major character encoding standard for data processing. Most modern computer systems use Unicode, also known as the Unicode Worldwide Character Standard. It's a character encoding standard that includes ASCII encodings.

 For example : ASCII value of uppercase alphabets(A-Z) – 65 to 90. ASCII value of lowercase alphabets(a-z) – 97 to 122.

 ### EBCDIC

Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code
EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code ) is a binary code for alphabetic and numeric characters that IBM developed for its larger operating systems.

For example, setting the first nibble to all-ones,1111, defines the character as a number, and the second nibble defines which number is encoded. EBCDIC can code up to 256 different characters.


## Gray Codes 

Gray code evaluates the nature of binary code or data that is composed of on and off indicators, commonly represented by ones and zeros. Developed by Bell Labs scientists, gray code has been used to look at clarity and error correction in binary communications. Gray code is also known as reflected binary code.

For example: the representation of the decimal value "1" in binary would normally be "001" and "2" would be "010". In Gray code, these values are represented as "001" and "011". That way, incrementing a value from 1 to 2 requires only one bit to change, instead of two. 



| Decimal Number |	Binary Number |	Gray Code |
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 0000 | 0000 | |
|1 |  0001 | 	0001 |
| 2 |	0010 |	0011 |
|3| 	0011 |	0010|
|4 |	0100 |	0110|
|5| 	0101 |	0111|
|6 |	0110 |	0101|
|7 |	0111 |	0100|
|8 |	1000 |	1100|
|9 	|1001 |	1101|
|10 |	1010 |	1111|
|11 |	1011 	|1110|
|12 |	1100 |	1010|
|13 |	|1101 |	1011|
|14 |	1110 	|1001|
|15 |	1111| 	1000|

## Laws of Boolean Algebra:


Annulment Law – A term AND‘ed with a 0 equals 0 or OR with a 1 will equal 1
 
> $A . 0 = 0$ A variable AND’ed with 0 is always equal to 0

> $A + 1 = 1$   A variable OR’ed with 1 is always equal to 1

 
Identity Law – A term OR with a 0 or AND with a 1 will always equal that term
 

> $A + 0 = A$ A variable OR with 0 is always equal to the variable  
> $A \cdot 1 = A$ A variable AND’ed with 1 is always equal to the variable

 
Idempotent Law – An input that is AND or OR with itself is equal to that input
 
>$ A + A = A $    A variable OR’ed with itself is always equal to the variable

> $ A . A = A $    A variable AND’ed with itself is always equal to the variable

 
Complement Law – A term AND‘ed with its complement equals 0 and a term OR´ed with its complement equals 1.
 
>$ A . A = 0 $   A variable AND’ed with its complement is always equal to 0

>   $ A + A = 1$    A variable OR’ed with its complement is always equal to 1

 
Commutative Law – The order of application of two separate terms is not important
 
>$A . B = B . A$    The order in which two variables are AND’ed makes no difference
 
> $  A + B = B + A $   The order in which two variables are OR’ed makes no difference

 
Double Negation Law – A term that is inverted twice is equal to the original term
 

>$ A = A  $   A double complement of a variable is always equal to the variable


De-Morgan's Law:

>$(A+B)' = A'.B'$

>$(A.B)' = A'+B'$


## Boolean Functions
 AND gate
 >The AND gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output (1) only if all its inputs are high.  A dot (.) is used to show the AND operation i.e. A.B.  Bear in mind that this dot is sometimes omitted i.e. AB

     
OR gate

            		
>  The OR gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output (1) if one or more of its inputs are high.  A plus (+) is used to show the OR operation.

         

 NOT gate

            		
>The NOT gate is an electronic circuit that produces an inverted version of the input at its output.  It is also known as an inverter.  If the input variable is A, the inverted output is known as NOT A.  This is also shown as A', or A with a bar over the top, as shown at the outputs. The diagrams below show two ways that the NAND logic gate can be configured to produce a NOT gate. It can also be done using NOR logic gates in the same way.

     
NAND gate

            		
> This is a NOT-AND gate which is equal to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate.  The outputs of all NAND gates are high if any of the inputs are low. The symbol is an AND gate with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents inversion.

     
NOR gate

            		
>This is a NOT-OR gate which is equal to an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.  The outputs of all NOR gates are low if any of the inputs are high. 
The symbol is an OR gate with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents inversion.

     

     
EXOR gate

> The 'Exclusive-OR' gate is a circuit which will give a high output if either, but not both, of its two inputs are high.  An encircled plus sign () is used to show the EOR operation. 

EXNOR gate

> The 'Exclusive-NOR' gate circuit does the opposite to the EOR gate. It will give a low output if either, but not both, of its two inputs are high. The symbol is an EXOR gate with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents inversion.

    
The NAND and NOR gates are called universal functions since with either one the AND and OR functions and NOT can be generated.

Note:
 A function in sum of products form can be implemented using NAND gates by replacing all AND and OR gates by NAND gates.

 A function in product of sums form can be implemented using NOR gates by replacing all AND and OR gates by NOR gates.

## Minterm and Maxterm :

### *Minterm* - 

The product of all literals, either with complement or without complement, is known as minterm. 


Using variable values, we can write the minterms as:

>If the variable value is 1, we will take the variable without its complement.

> If the variable value is 0, take its complement.

In the first step, we will write the term consisting of all the variables
Next, we will write 0 in place of all the complement variables such as ~A or A'.
We will write 1 in place of all the non-complement variables such as A or b.
Now, we will find the decimal number of the binary formed from the above steps.
In the end, we will write the decimal number as a subscript of letter m(minterm). Let's take some example to understand the theory of shorthand notation

>Example :- Minterm = AB'C'
  First, we will write the minterm:
    Minterm = AB'C'
    Now, we will write 0 in place of complement variables B' and C'.
    Minterm = A00
    We will write 1 in place of non-complement variable A.
    Minterm = 100
    The binary number of the minterm AB'C' is 100. The decimal point number of (100)2 is 4. So, the shorthand notation of AB'C' is
    Minterm = m4


### *Maxterm-*

The sum of all literals, either with complement or without complement, is known as maxterm.

Using the given variable values, we can write the maxterm as:

> If the variable value is 1, then we will take the variable without a complement.

>If the variable value is 0, take the complement of the variable.


> In the first step, we will write the term consisting of all the variables
Next, we will write 0 in place of all the complement variables such as ~A or A'.
 We will write 1 in place of all the non-complement variables such as A or b.
Now, we will find the decimal number of the binary formed from the above steps.
In the end, we will write the decimal number as a subscript of letter Here, M denotes maxterm.

>Example:- Maxterm = A+B'+C'
>First, we will write the maxterm:
Maxterm = A+B'+C'
Now, we will write 0 in place of complement variables B' and C'.
We will write 1 in place of non-complement variable A.
The binary number of the maxterm A+B'+C' is 100. The decimal point number of (100)2 is 4. So, the maxterm of A+B'+C' is m4.

## Simplification of Boolean Expressions using Algebraic Method:

When a Boolean expression is implemented with logic gates, each literal in the function is 
designated as input to the gate. Minimization of the number of literals and the number of terms leads to 
less complex circuits as well as less number of gates, which should be a designer’s aim. 
There are several methods to minimize the Boolean function. Here, simplification or minimization of 
complex algebraic expressions will be shown with the help of postulates and theorems of Boolean algebra.
This minimization procedure is not unique because it lacks specific rules to predict the succeeding step in 
the manipulative process.

>Example 1:
 Simplify the Boolean function F=AB+ BC + B′C.
Solution. F = AB + BC + B′C
= AB + C(B + B′)
= AB + C

>Example 2: 
Simplify the Boolean function F= A + A′B.
Solution. F = A+ A′B
= (A + A′) (A + B)
= A + B

>Example 3: 
Simplify the Boolean function F= A′B′C + A′BC + AB′.
Solution. F = A′B′C + A′BC + AB′
= A′C (B′+B) + AB′
= A′C + AB′

Example 4: 
Simplify the Boolean function 

$F = AB + (AC)′ + AB′C(AB + C).$

Solution. F = AB + (AC)′ + AB′C(AB + C)

= AB + A′ + C′+ AB′C.AB + AB′C.C

= AB + A′ + C′ + 0 + AB′C  *(B.B′ = 0 and C.C = C)*

= ABC + ABC′ + A′ + C′ + AB′C *(AB = AB(C + C′) = ABC + ABC′)*

= AC(B + B′) + C′(AB + 1) + A′

= AC + C′+A′ *(B + B′ = 1 and AB + 1 = 1)*

= AC + (AC)′ = 1
